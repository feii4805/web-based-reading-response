        <h4>Quote</h4>
        <p>"All the packets for a given item of data circulate freely on the network and are assembled into a sort of collage on the recipient computer.
             Finally, the whole infrastructure network itself is based on an assembly of autonomous networks together: this ability is called "interoperability".</p>
        <h4>Response</h4>
        <p>The internet might look simple on the surface, but its architecture is complex. "The Internet is a collage of heterogeneous networks. It is a network of networks". It can pre-empt users' need, collect information to match the user's interest. It is both universal and individual because every user is different. Does that mean we can apprehend that we are all internet sculptors?</p>
